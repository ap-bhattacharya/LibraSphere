# LibraSphere â€“ Smart Library Management System

LibraSphere is a web-based library management system built using Flask and MySQL. It supports role-based access control (RBAC) with three types of users: Super Admin, Admin, and User. Each role comes with its own set of permissions to manage books, users, and borrowing records.

## Features

LibraSphere allows Super Admins to manage both Admin and User accounts, as well as the book inventory. Admins can manage books and view user data, while regular Users can browse available books and borrow them. The system includes secure registration and login, user profile management, and real-time book borrowing with return tracking. An admin dashboard is also integrated using Flask-Admin for convenient backend management.
